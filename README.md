# QueueTTS

QueueTTS is a local-first, static web app that turns article text into continuous text-to-speech playback using a real queue. Add multiple items (paste text or try a URL), then play through segmented speech-safe chunks like a music playlist.

## Running locally

Open `index.html` directly or serve the folder:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.
